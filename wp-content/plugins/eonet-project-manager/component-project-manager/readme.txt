Make your site a complete project management tool: create projects, set permissions and assign tasks your users.

== Description ==

*Make your site a complete project management tool*.

Eonet Project Manager can be added to any site and easily customized to fit your design purposes.
It allows you to create many projects with different permission levels, create tasks for them and assign the tasks to
the users of your site.

The projects can have many restriction levels (such as visible to everyone or only tothe members),
and you can set a different restriction level for each project.
In addition, the members of the projects are not obligated to use the backend to work on it,
they can handle the tasks and add messages just by frontend; in this way you can create a Project Management web-app,
with a nice style.

If you want, you can also totally customize the layout of the pages and elements, there are a ton of hooks for this
 purpose; or you can just clone the files in your child theme and customize them from there, as the most famous plugins.
