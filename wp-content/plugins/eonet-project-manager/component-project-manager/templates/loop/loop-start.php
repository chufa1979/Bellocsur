 * This template can be overridden by copying it to yourtheme/eonet-project-manager/loop/loop-start.php.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: We will try to update this template file as little as possible,
 * but on occasion it will happens, above all in the early versions. When this happens,
 * you (the theme developer) will need to copy the new files to your theme to maintain compatibility.
 * If you want to avoid this, we strongly suggest you to use hooks when you can,
 * instead of override whole template files
